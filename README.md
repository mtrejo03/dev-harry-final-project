# Book Tracker ðŸ“š

This web-based application allows for a reader/user to log the book that they are currently reading by filling out a simple form asking for basic information about the book. It also allows for future modification of a logged book. 

## Notable features: 
- Customizable Options: reader name, book title, genre, rating, platform, review
- Simple Design: Clean, easy to read form

**As a** avid reader,

**I want to** log the books I am currently reading

**So that** I can modify them when necessary
